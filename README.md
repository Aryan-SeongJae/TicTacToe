# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a really fun game that everyone around the world has played once in their life. I have tried to recreate a very simple version of Tic tac Toe that 2 players can play.

##Used Concepts:
  -> Systematic Design Programming
  -> Separating UI and Model classes
  -> JUnit, Java Swing

## Future Additions
  -> Test Packages
  -> Multiplayer support with data persistance by saving data on device and later creating a server.
